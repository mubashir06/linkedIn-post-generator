      "text": "In the past few days, even my cat hashtag#Omao couldn’t resist the trend. She proudly posted several AI-generated portraits of herself in full Studio Ghibli glory—wide-eyed, dreamlike, and ready for a cameo in Spirited Away.\n\nThere’s just one problem: Studio Ghibli never asked for this, nor approved it.\nLet’s be clear—this trend brought joy. It likely made Ghibli even more famous (Omao, for one, had never heard of it before). But it also made painfully visible a deeper issue: none of this art was created or sanctioned by the studio. And while an algorithm can imitate a style, it can’t replicate the soul of human-made storytelling.\n\nHayao Miyazaki has famously called AI-generated art “an insult to life itself.” Maybe that’s harsh—but he has a point. These Ghibli-style images are remixes, not stories. They mimic the magic without earning it. And they raise tricky questions: Who owns a style? Who gets credit? Who gets paid?\n\nAI tools are powerful, fun—even transformative. But let’s not forget to champion the real artists, the human hands and hearts behind the originals. Because while Omao looks adorable as an anime heroine, there’s no algorithm that can replace true imagination.\n\nHuman creativity isn’t just style. It’s story. And it’s worth protecting.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dz3y7_bu",

Here’s a snapshot of 6 top LLM models shaping the industry:\n\n✅ GPT-4 – Unmatched in dialogue & reasoning, but proprietary\n✅ Claude 3.5 – Best for writing & coding, yet lacks real-time data\n✅ Gemini – Advanced capabilities, yet concerns on data privacy\n✅ DeepSeek-R1 – Open-source & cost-efficient, but less known\n✅ LLaMA 3.2 – Flexible & multimodal, though resource-heavy\n✅ Mistral L2 – Efficient & safe, but not fully open-source\n\nThe right choice depends on your use case, scalability needs, and data privacy considerations. Open-source is gaining traction, but proprietary models still dominate enterprise AI.",

But equally interesting is the explosive rise of specialized platforms like DeepSeek, which surged by 2,026% following the release of its reasoning model.\n\nThis makes me think we will see, in the coming months and years, the rise of many additional vertical platforms catering to even more specific AI use cases, such as healthcare diagnostics, legal analytics, personalized education tools, and industry-specific predictive analytics.\n\nAI is no longer a generalized novelty; it's rapidly becoming tailored, purpose-driven, and deeply integrated into specific aspects of work, creativity, and communication.\n\nAs leaders and innovators, the question isn't whether AI will shape our future—clearly, it already is. The real question is: how strategically are we leveraging these AI tools to drive meaningful change?\n\nHow is your organization navigating this specialized, AI-driven landscape?

      "text": "The most interesting trend in the new \"McKinsey & Company State of hashtag#AI 2025 report\" may be the surge in AI adoption in multiple company functions.\n\nThis highlights a fundamental shift in how organizations are integrating AI, moving from isolated experiments to widespread adoption across multiple functions. The proportion of organizations leveraging AI in five or more functions is expected to triple.\n\nAn accelerating expansion of AI beyond single-use cases signals a transition from exploratory implementations to full-scale business transformation. This suggests that AI is moving from incremental automation to a structural pillar of business strategy.\n\nCompanies that scale AI across multiple functions will gain significant advantages in operational efficiency, strategic decision-making, and innovation, while those that hesitate risk losing competitiveness.\n\nAs organizations embrace AI more holistically, leadership teams will need to navigate not just the technological aspects, but also the cultural, operational, and governance dimensions of this shift.\n\nThe second half of 2025 could well be remembered as the tipping point when AI stopped being a differentiator and became a necessity.",
