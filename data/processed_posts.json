        "text": "Someone asked me this question recently at an AMA: \nHow does the data governance coming from Congress and even President Trump impact how big tech companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI are developing their models? \n(Thanks for your question, Eashan Kosaraju.)\n\nHere's the video of my answer: https://lnkd.in/ewQy9-6Z\n\nHere's the written version: \nGenerally, it makes good financial sense for big companies to follow laws and regulations. \nSo when we see sweeping legislation passed, companies will usually comply. \nBut when regulation is designed to be \"one and done\"\u2014as if we can solve it once and never revisit it\u2014that's where I start to worry. \nThat approach can have unintended consequences.\n\nPersonally, I prefer incremental governance, especially when dealing with complex systems whose long-term effects are difficult to predict. \nIf data governance has a one-size-fits-all mindset to \"future-proofing\" then we won't be future-proof. \nSweeping legislation can restrict the best outcomes we might otherwise see from these companies.\n\nI spent nearly a decade at Google, and I genuinely believe that making the world\u2019s information universally accessible and useful is a powerful mission. \nBut if we overregulate, we risk losing a lot of the good that comes from that work.\n\nAt the same time, information can clearly be misused. \nI agree with Congressman Jay Obernolte's take that \"it\u2019s already illegal for someone to steal your money\u2014we don\u2019t need a new law making it illegal to use AI to do it.\" \nThe issue often isn\u2019t about inventing new laws, but enforcing the ones we already have, particularly when it comes to data privacy violations and leaks.\n\nThese huge companies have a huge responsibility. \nThey must be careful stewards of data, not just because governments say so, but because their long-term success depends on it. \nIn fact, I\u2019d argue that the internal incentives for handling data responsibly are often stronger than what external regulation can enforce.\n\nBack when I was at Google, friends and family used to speculate about the company doing all kinds of sketchy things with data. \nAnd I\u2019d think, \u201cIf that were true\u2014my job as a data scientist would\u2019ve been so much easier.\u201d \nThe truth is, there's already a strong culture of caution around data in many of these organizations.\n\nSo yes, governments play an important role. \nBut I\u2019d urge caution for any government that wants to pass a single set of sweeping policies, call it done, and then expect those policies to hold up forever. \nThat\u2019s not how complex systems work.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/ewQy9-6Z",
